# How_To_Talk_About_Code 
<!-- Synopsis Start -->
Often, when developers ask for help, report bugs, or try to explain concepts to other developers we fail to convey our ideas successfully. Hopefully some of the ideas here can help; this article contains my thoughts on talking about code in ways that can further ideas along and help us find resolutions to our problems more quickly.
<!-- Synopsis End -->

## Due Diligence Done aka Ducks In A Row aka At Least Try To Fix It Yourself
seek to understand your problem from all sides
take a break, sleep on it if you can
try to narrow down the scope of your problem

## Attitude is Everything aka Seek Not to Blame
don't be a dick and blame other people or their code
if you don't like something about opc, put in a PR or STFU

## Be Explicit aka Say What You Mean
The only thing worse than an incorrect answer is a vague question. If your question is incoherent, ambiguous, or incomplete, then at best your answer will be the same.

for example "I'm using some package to do a thing and it fails" is insufficient information to elicit a useful response. Use the complete package name or better provide a link to the specific package. 

## Limit Prose aka Use Assertions

## Succinct or Die 

## Completeness is King

## On the Importance of Vocabulary

## known unknowns and unknown knowns wtfk?

## challenge your own expectations aka you don't know what you think you know

## Situational Awareness aka help others but know when to hang back
