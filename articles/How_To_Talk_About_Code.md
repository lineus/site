# How_To_Talk_About_Code 
<!-- Synopsis Start -->
Often when we ask for help, report bugs, or try to explain concepts to other developers we fail to convey our ideas successfully. Hopefully some of the ideas here can help; This article contains my thoughts on talking about code in ways that can further ideas along and help us find resolutions to our problems more quickly.
<!-- Synopsis End -->

## Due Diligence Done aka Ducks In A Row aka At Least Try To Fix It Yourself
seek to understand your problem from all sides
take a break, sleep on it if you can

## narrow down the scope of your problem 
At the outset of a problem, generally speaking, "it doesn't work". If that's the phrase 
you choose to ask for help with, you have already failed. By all means, spend n minutes 
playing with it to make it work, but when your patience runs out, try these steps to 
break down your problem:

   1. x
   1. y
   1. z

## Attitude is Everything aka Seek Not to Blame
don't be a dick and blame other people or their code
if you don't like something about opc, put in a PR or STFU

## Be Explicit aka Say What You Mean
The only thing worse than an incorrect answer is a vague question. If your question is incoherent, ambiguous, or incomplete, then at best your  answer will be the same.

for example "I'm using some package to do a thing and it fails" is insufficient information to elicit a useful response. Use the complete package name or better provide a link to the specific package. Share the full output/error text.

## Limit Prose aka Use Assertions



## Succinct or Die 


## Completeness is King

You've discovered what you think is a bug, or might be a bug, in someone else's code. Now you want to report it or discuss it with other folks, but it's deeply intertwined with your code and the 1400 other packages in your project. What to do? You must abstract the smallest amount of code possible to reproduce the results you are seeing and create a standalone 

## On the Importance of Vocabulary

## known unknowns and unknown knowns aka who the fuck knows?

If you're reporting an issue about a node.js process, do you understand how the node.js runtime works? 

If you're in a browser environment, are you familiar with the DOM?

## challenge your own assumptions aka you don't know what you think you know

## Situational Awareness aka help others but know when to hang back

## RTFM

## Widdle away The Noise

If you're not reporting a bug about typescript, don't use typescript
if you're reporting a bug about axios don't install express to demonstrate
focus as closely as possible on the issue at hand.
