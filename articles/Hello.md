## Location

I was born and raised in the arid desert of the Southwestern United States, but I currently live in the Eastern timezone.

## The Past is Behind Us

I have had many jobs over the years.
delivered newspapers before dawn on a bicycle
 Unofficialy, my first hourly job was digging ditches for a plumber. This only lasted for a few months during the summer until I turned fourteen and a half, at which point I became legally old enough to work according to the state. 
 It was then that I took my first official job, at McDonald's. I stayed there for several years. 
 I've stuffed inserts into newspapers on the third shift.
 I sold lottery tickets, booze, and cigarettes to articleal workers from behind bullet-proof glass in downtown detroit.
 Since then, I've been a waiter in restaurants big and small, and fixed copiers for a local sales/service company. I have worked as a door to door salesman where I earned 100% of my wages from commission and as a runner at a theme park, beer-backing at concerts and hawking t-shirts at prize fights. , , and scrubbed toilets and floors at newspapers. I've been a roofer in the midwest in February (and all of the other months) a laborer for a general contractor, and a front desk clerk at a hotel/apartment building. A lot of these were at the same time. Then I turned 25 and graduated from technical school where I became a remote switchman for the phone company working in a NOC-like environment. This is where I fell in love with UNIX and never looked back. Since then, I've racked and cabled equipment in a massive datacenter, spent more time in a NOC for a popular internet company, and eventually became a UNIX sysadmin and Service Engineer.

## The Future is Now

My next job will be as a javascript developer. I love javascript. It's my favorite language to code in. I want to learn everything I can about it. From the various parts of the language and syntax, to how it works under the hood. I probably lean a little towards writing backend code in nodejs, but I have just as much fun writing code for the browser.
