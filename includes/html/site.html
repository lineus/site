  I don't have any advertising on lineus.dev, and I have no
  intention of adding any. My hope is that every once and a 
  while, when you find useful information here, you
  will buy me a cup of coffee at the link below. If you can't
  afford a cup of coffee, then drop me a note and just say
  thanks!
