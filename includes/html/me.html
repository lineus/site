  My name is Kevin Huff, but please, <strong>call me Kev!</strong>
</p>
<p class="abt">
  I have lived all over these United States. 
  Currently I call Ohio home, but unless I'm 
  there,  <strong> I'll always miss the desert. </strong>
</p>
<p class="abt">
  Though the focus of my career has mainly
  been on systems administration and service
  engineering, my educational background is in electronics,
  and I aspire to be a full-stack javascript developer.
</p>
<p class="abt">
  I've written python, perl, and bash in production,
  contributed javascript to the node mongodb ODM package 
  mongoose, and I'm learning C/C++, ruby, rust, and go.
</p>
<p class="abt">
  I don't do social media of any kind, it's a plague, but I'm
  a very sociable person.
